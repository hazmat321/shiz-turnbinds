- draggable always on top yaw adjust (click and scroll to increase/decrease)
- auto activate/deactivate when opening cs2
- customizable binds for +left, +right, strafe modifier
- auto saves presets, auto save yawspeed draggable location

## NOTE
- this requires no additional installs, and it doesn't require administrator to run

## how to use
- download
- put .exe in folder named whatever you want
- run exe

use arrow keys to move, side arrow keys to adjust from console menu

## VAC
This does not read/write/modifying anything from the game. I think it's probably more safe than using high DPI mouse in matchmaking..
